Hooke's Atom is just a code for plotting the radial wave function of the Helium like rubber band model of an atom proposed by Hooke.

AMPQ3 involves calculating the expectation values of r, r^2 and 1/r on the Hydrogenic wave function. The coefficients of the radial part have been calculated via a recurrence relation.
